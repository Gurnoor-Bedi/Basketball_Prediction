# Basketball Player Performance Analysis

This Python script is designed to analyze and visualize basketball player performance data over a period of weeks. The data includes statistics on free throws, 2-pointers, 3-pointers, and passes made by the player.

## Features

- Analysis of free throw attempts and success rate.
- Visualization of the distribution of free throws attempted.
- Comparison of 2-pointers and 3-pointers made over time.
- Trend analysis of passes made each week.
- Correlation matrix heatmap to understand relationships between different performance metrics.
- Linear regression to predict future performance.

## Usage

The script performs the following analyses:

1. **Free Throw Analysis**: Calculates and visualizes the distribution of free throws attempted and the player's free throw percentage.
2. **Shot Analysis**: Compares the number of 2-pointers and 3-pointers made over time.
3. **Pass Analysis**: Visualizes the number of passes made each week.
4. **Correlation Analysis**: Generates a heatmap showing the correlation between different performance metrics.
5. **Predictive Analysis**: Uses linear regression to predict the free throw percentage for future weeks.

## Installation and Setup
